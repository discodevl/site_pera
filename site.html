            i felt the sea talking to me one day, on a acid trip. it told me
            things i've yet to understand, but i feel it was all about allowing
            myself to go on new journeys. in search of a place i saw when
            looking at the sea, a place i know exists somewhere inside me. the
            word <strong>"scuopnuo"</strong> appeared to me and another friend
            during that experience. searching for it online i couldn't find
            anything, which leads me to believe that we created it, on a trip,
            at the same time. that was a cool experience, and i wanted it to be
            the starting point of something. welcome to my personal growth
            journey through the world of disruptive a/v art.
